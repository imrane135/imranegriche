        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            This project implements a face recognition system that can identify and verify individuals from video streams.<br>
             The system leverages deep learning-based face detection and recognition models to analyze facial features and compare them against a database of known individuals it gives also the option to add new faces (sign up).<br> The project integrates a MySQL database to store and manage facial embeddings, user details, and authentication logs. The system can be used for various applications, such as attendance tracking, security authentication, and access control.
